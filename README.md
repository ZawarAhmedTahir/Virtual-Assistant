# Virtual-Assistant
It was my third semester project for data structure and algorithms course. It was a simple java desktop application. It uses Jsapi speech API to interact with user. Linked list were used as data structure. The main features of this project were that we can schedule, create, delete, and update our events our events. First there is a login form where the user should login into by entering user ID and password. or we can also signup just like any other standard application. Next it it will show up the home screen on which the upcoming 3 events will be shown with there name, time and date. Assistant will also notify you when the event date and time are reached
